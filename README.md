**Maze Traversal Program with Stacks**

- using a Python Stack data structure with lists
- given certain positions (x,y) coordinates, the stack data structure keeps track of all coordinates
- manually keeps track of positions
- 'g' is the goal, ' ' is an empty space, '+' is a wall
- the program traverses a maze given a starting coordinate and replaces each empty space with
  the current number of steps
- purpose is to make sure that all directions of the maze are checked, and that the
  coordinates of visited spaces are pushed onto the stack
